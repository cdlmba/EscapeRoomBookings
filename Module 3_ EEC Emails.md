**Subject:** Welcome to The Local Loyalty Playbook\!

**Sub-text:** I’m going to help you avoid the 5 biggest mistakes Escape Room owners make trying to market to local players like tourists.

Hey there\!

Thanks for subscribing to *The Local Loyalty Playbook: Escape Room Owners in Tourist Markets: Avoid These 5 Mistakes That Kill Local Repeat Bookings, Leave You Dependent on One-Time Tourists, and Force You to Constantly Discount (And How To Fix Them Even If Your Rooms Are “Fully Booked” on Weekends).*

“Hey\! You’re from \[neighboring town\]\! Cool, glad you came.”

If locals only play once (or never come at all), your business is built on replacement, not growth.

That means:

* New ads every month  
* New tourists every season  
* New rooms just to stay at break-even

Over the next 5 days, I’ll break down the **exact mistakes** that cap local repeat bookings and quietly drain **$8k–$20k per month** from tourist-market escape rooms.

One important note before we start:

* Most of these problems don’t come from operations.  
* They come from **what you say, when you say it, and how consistently you say it**.

I’ll explain the mistakes first.

Then I’ll show you how operators fix them without major overhauls or huge advertising spend.

Over the next 5 days, here’s what we’re going to cover:

* **Mistake \#1:** *Treating locals like tourists*. Why locals come once, never return, and tell friends “it’s fun… once.”  
* **Mistake \#2:** *Relying on new rooms as the only reason to return*; you burn $25K-$50K or more on constant rebuilds just to stay relevant.  
* **Mistake \#3:** *No post-game relationship* and why customers leave, forget you exist, and book your competitors next time.  
* **Mistake \#4:** *Discounts instead of reasons* or why locals only come back when you slash prices, which is killing your margins.  
* **Mistake \#5:** *No local identity*, which is why you’re interchangeable with every other escape room within 50 miles.

By the end of this 5-Day Educational Email Course, you are going to know exactly why you should avoid these 5 giant mistakes on your path to attract and retain local players and what you should do instead.

So, keep an eye on your inbox\! In one hour, you’ll receive Lesson 1\.

**Ready, player one.**

# Day 1 \- Locals Aren't Tourists

## **Day 1 — mistake \#1: treating locals like tourists**

### **Subject: Mistake \#1: locals are just like tourists**

### **Sub-text: Tourists want novelty; locals want belonging**

### **Introduction**

Hey there\!

Welcome to Day 1 of The Local Loyalty Playbook.

Today we’re going to talk about Mistake \#1: Treating locals like tourists.

Specifically:

* The reason operators make locals feel invisible to escape room centers..  
* Why this mistake leads to one-time customer value instead of lifetime value.  
* And how to fix it.

Clock’s ticking. Let’s get to it.

### **Mistake \#1: Treating locals like tourists**

Do you want to know why most locals never come back to an escape room in a tourist town?

It’s not because they hate playing escape games. It’s not even because the rooms aren’t playable. It’s not even because something broke during the game (don’t worry, we know it happens \- it’s all in how you react).

It’s because every escape room talks to locals the same way they talk to visitors.

This mistake leads to the following outcomes:

* **Kills word-of-mouth in your community:** Locals are your most valuable marketing asset in a tourist market. When they have a mediocre "tourist experience," they won't recommend you to visiting friends and family. You’re missing out on the easiest repeat booking you'll ever get.  
* **Forces you into the weekend-only trap:** Without local repeat customers filling your Tuesday and Wednesday slots, you're stuck being "feast or famine," packed on weekends with tourists, dead during the week. This kills revenue potential and makes it nearly impossible to retain quality staff.  
* **Makes you forgettable:** When locals see you as "just another tourist thing to do," you become the same as mini-golf, the wax museum, and every other attraction they'd never visit twice. You're not on their radar for date nights, team building, or celebrations.

Corporate bookings and parties are scarce. And thus, the same funnel you’re expecting to bring you their coworkers, their kids’ friends, etc. dries up. Who’s going to know that the escape room exists?

### **The reason this happens**

The reason this happens is that escape room owners are busy. They get caught in the customer acquisition trap.

This is especially true in a tourist area, where they are relying on searches from tourists finding something to do. The temptation is to shout in a virtually loud room and hope anyone notices. Or possibly find the escape room in a prime location.

What they don’t find are the locals that are ready to come back during slow seasons.

Here's the problem: locals don't want to be treated like tourists in their own town.

Here are some specific reasons why escape rooms tend to take a shotgun approach to all customers:

* **Website analytics alone make it hard to distinguish locals from tourists.** Website traffic? Even with Google Analytics, you can’t tell who is visiting from your ZIP code versus who is from across the country.  
* **Social media feels like a way to generate buzz.** It’s easy to pour time into social media as a way to connect. But when all the posts are “Bob and his family from \[states away\] came by today,” then it’s hard to believe that “Jane and her family from \[a few streets over\]” has a place with the escape room.  
* **Segmenting email lists can be confusing.** Thus, locals get the same emails:  
  * Get a discount?  
  * We have a new room\!  
  * Coming back to our area?  
* **Same “first-time experience” framing:** An escape room is constantly trying to sell its entire audience on why escape rooms are awesome. Trouble is, you’re selling an escape room experience to people who have already bought\! And particularly, from you\!

### **The fix**

So, how do you avoid this mistake?

It comes down to a know your customer (“KYC”) systems approach. Knowing the customer coming in and what experience they have with rooms, if they are local, and what drew them in is crucial to building loyalty.

You want some specifics.

Instead of ignoring your locals, you should do these things:

* **Normalize the experience:** Frame playing escape rooms not as a one-off tourist activity, but as a regular, expected form of local entertainment—like going to the local cinema or bowling alley. This moves you from one-off novelty to something that can be done over and over throughout the year.  
* **Clear and compelling next steps:** Always include information about the next available room, new themes, or special seasonal events. Make the next booking decision as easy as possible. Example: "Conquered 'The Pharaoh's Curse'? Our new room, 'The Last Starship,' launches next month—book your return mission now\!"  
* **Incentivize loyalty:** Implement loyalty programs or offer "Local Resident" discounts/previews for rooms they haven’t played yet. This makes return visits feel like a privileged benefit of being part of the local community.  
* **Segment your marketing by audience:** Run separate campaigns for locals versus tourists. For tourists, lean into the "fun vacation activity" angle. For locals, focus on community, repeat experiences, and positioning yourself as the go-to spot for birthdays, date nights, corporate events, and friend gatherings. Your messaging should make locals feel like insiders, not visitors.  
* **Train your staff to recognize and remember locals:** This is simple but powerful. Have your team ask during booking or check-in: "Are you local or visiting?" Update the CRM with a flag for local customer. (Local is up to you, but a good rule of thumb is that they could drive to your location and back within 2 hours based on their home address). If they're local, treat them differently—welcome them back, ask how they heard about you, offer to walk them through what makes your rooms perfect for repeat visits. Recognition builds loyalty faster than any discount ever will.

This isn’t about more marketing.

It’s about better-written messaging aimed at locals only.

I hope this gives you more clarity around how locals can help you grow your tourist-focused escape room business.

Come back tomorrow, where we’re going to dig into why new rooms don’t solve the local customer loyalty problem — and often make it worse.

# Day 2 \- The Build And They Will Come Trap

## **Day 2 — mistake \#2: relying on new rooms for repeat business**

### **Subject: Mistake \#2: build it and they will come…back trap**

### **Sub-text: Spending money on rebuilds doesn’t guarantee more local bookings**

### **Introduction**

Hey there\!

Welcome to Day 2 of The Local Loyalty Playbook.

Today we’re going to talk about Mistake \#2: Relying on new rooms to attract local replays.

Specifically:

* Why spending $25K-$50K on a room rebuild does nothing for local players.  
* Why this mistake just gets you at break-even with new customers, maybe.  
* And how to fix it.

Let’s dive in.

### **Mistake \#2: Relying on new rooms as the only reason to return**

Selfishly, I love seeing new rooms and new scenarios from an escape room center. But I can’t abide the thought that a rebuild has set back the business $25K or more.

You spend $30K, $40K, sometimes $50K+ designing, building, and launching a new room. You get a brief spike in local bookings for 6-8 weeks. Then the novelty wears off, and you're right back where you started—looking at empty weeknight slots and planning your next expensive build.

New rooms feel like growth. They’re exciting. They can give you something to talk about on social media or for new guests coming in the door. But they cost A LOT to pull off.

Here are the negative outcomes:

* **You lose an entire room during the rebuild; that’s lost revenue.** You can’t get customers in a room marked “Construction Zone.” Safety aside, that’d be a cool room idea, though. But I digress.  
* **You train locals to wait to come back until there’s a new room.** It might be the reason they came initially. And if they come back with your “There’s a new room\!” promo, then that’s the only reason they might consider coming back. That’s an expensive way to get a customer.  
* **More headaches.** New design concept. More permits to rebuild. More red tape with the local government. Dust. Caution tape. Literal nails.

### **The reason this happens**

The reason this happens is because most escape room owners confuse "novelty" with "value."

A new thing just feels right. Surely a nice new thing is better than what feels like a tired old concept? Besides, you got into escape room ownership because you LOVE new challenges.

Locals stop coming back because you haven't given them a reason to return beyond just solving new puzzles.

But all we’re doing here is trying to retain old customers by ignoring the reasons they came originally.

Here are some more specific reasons escape room operators fall into the “Build it and they will come” trap:

* **You're copying what theme parks do (but you're not a theme park):** Disney can justify spending millions on a new ride because they have tens of millions of visitors and massive economies of scale. You don't. When you try to copy their "always building something new" strategy, you're playing a game you mathematically cannot win. Your market is too small, and your margins are too thin.  
* **You think puzzles are your product (they're not):** Your product isn't the puzzle. Instead, it's the experience, the social bonding, the memories, and the feeling people get when they're at your venue. When you only build new puzzle rooms, you're building a "content library" instead of an experience destination. That's why people ghost you after they've "completed" your rooms.  
* **You're ignoring what actually drives repeat behavior:** The escape rooms that build true local loyalty aren't the ones with 8 different rooms. They're the place locals think of for celebrations, competitions, team events, and experiences that go beyond "book a room, solve puzzles, leave."

### **The fix**

So how do we avoid this mistake?

The truth is, you can create a thriving repeat business with just 3-4 solid rooms if you layer in the right retention strategies.

Instead of defaulting to "we need a new room" every time bookings dip, here's what you should do instead:

* **Create seasonal and event-based variations of existing rooms:** Take your best room and create a "Halloween edition" in October, a "Holiday Mystery" in December, or a "Summer Challenge Mode" with different puzzles and difficulty. You're using the same physical space and props, just swapping out 30-40% of the experience. Locals get something fresh without you spending $40K on a new build.  
* **Launch a leaderboard and monthly competition system:** Give people a reason to replay your rooms by gamifying the experience. Create a public leaderboard (digital or physical in your lobby), track fastest times, and run monthly competitions with prizes. Suddenly, locals aren't asking "Have I done this room?"—they're asking "Can I beat my time?" or "Can we knock Sarah's team off the \#1 spot?"  
* **Build a locals event calendar that has nothing to do with your rooms:** Host trivia nights in your lobby, murder mystery dinners, game nights, or "Escape Room Owner Live Q\&A" sessions where you teach puzzle design. Your venue becomes a community hub, not just a puzzle factory. When locals see you as a destination for entertainment beyond just escape rooms, they'll think of you first for all kinds of occasions—and book rooms more frequently as a result.

Operators who fix this stop chasing novelty and start compounding loyalty.

We just unlocked why spending more money to generate marketing buzz actually detonated the bomb and ended the game.

I hope this gave you more clarity about why leading with loyalty reduces long-term capital expenses and normalizes repeat player revenue.

Tomorrow we’ll dig into why the first few minutes after a game can make or break your customer loyalty. It’s the silent leak that kills future revenue.

Specifically:

* Why you’re leaving money on the table without a way to connect with locals.  
* Why this mistake costs you repeat plays, referral to new customers, and corporate bookings.  
* And how to fix it.

# Day 3 \- Post-Game Slump

## **Day 3 — mistake \#3: no post-game relationship**

### **Subject: Mistake \#3: one game; that’s it**

### **Sub-text: You’ve got 48 hours and you’re wasting it.**

### **Introduction**

Hey there\!

Welcome to Day 3 of The Local Loyalty Playbook.

Today we’re going to talk about Mistake \#3: No post-game relationship with local customers.

Specifically:

* Why you’re leaving money on the table without a way to connect with locals.  
* Why this mistake costs you repeat plays, referral to new customers, and corporate bookings.  
* And how to fix it.

Let’s dive in.

### **Mistake \#3: No post-game relationship**

Did you know that most buyers decide if they’ll come back within 5 minutes of their room being over?

If someone doesn’t come back, it can feel personal. It’s typically not. It’s because in the first few minutes after a game, the experience a local gets is “Well, hope you enjoyed it\!” The mistake there is that there’s no expectation of a continued relationship. It’s a first date without a lead to a second date or even an expectation that there’s more to come.

This leads to the following negative outcomes:

* **You lose the sale when they're most excited:** The absolute best time to book a customer's next visit is within 24-48 hours of their first experience—when they're still buzzing about how fun it was. With no follow-up system in place, that excitement fades, life gets busy, and the moment is gone forever. They'll book again eventually… just not with you.  
* **You're invisible during key booking moments:** When someone's planning their birthday, organizing a bachelorette party, or coordinating a team-building event, they're going to book with whoever's top-of-mind. If the only time you communicate with customers is when they're physically in your building, you're invisible during all these high-value booking opportunities.  
* **You have zero data on your best customers:** Without a post-game relationship, you have no idea who your superfans are, which customers would come back if you just asked, or who's likely to refer their friends. You're flying blind and making business decisions based on gut feel instead of actual customer behavior.

### **The reason this happens**

The reason this happens is because most escape rooms don’t have a clear path to identify next steps for new customers \- either local or tourist.

The customer sequence typically goes like this:

* Thanks for playing\! Glad you came?  
* We’re here if you want to come back\!  
* Are you on our email list? (with no clear or compelling why)  
* Do you want some merch? Why would they want merch unless it was a specific room or experience?  
* Let’s take a picture for our social media.

You don’t have a way to entice a player to play another room right away.

Let’s get into the reasons why this sequence often gets ignored:

* **There’s too little time to turn over rooms from prior bookings.** I get it. r/escaperooms is full of customer horror stories of intoxicated parties completely trashing a room. Now you have a booking right after it. What to do?  
* **You're treating escape rooms like a transaction instead of a relationship:** Most escape room owners have a "restaurant mindset." The customer walks in, pays, spends 60 minutes in the room, and leaves. But the businesses that win in the escape room industry have a "gym mindset" or "subscription mindset," where the sale isn't complete until the customer comes back. If you're not thinking about customer lifetime value, you're leaving 80% of potential revenue on the table.  
* **You think email marketing is spammy or annoying:** A lot of escape room owners resist building an email list or following up with customers because they don't want to "bother people." But here's the truth: people who just spent $150+ at your business and had a great time want to hear from you. They're not annoyed by a well-crafted email that offers value; they're annoyed when they miss out on events or promotions because you never told them.  
* **You have no system (so it never happens consistently):** Even if you know you should follow up with customers, you don't have a repeatable system for doing it. There's no automated email sequence, no CRM tracking repeat visits, no staff member whose job it is to nurture relationships. So it falls through the cracks every single time—not because you don't care, but because you're too busy running the business.

### **The fix**

So let’s get to the fix.

You can spend more time with the customer and give them all kinds of time describing the other rooms, your center, etc. You could take fewer bookings to nurture deeper relationships. But you’ve got other bookings coming in and that rent isn’t going to pay itself.

This is where a well-crafted email sequence tailored to their experience, their relationship to the local community, and getting them to connect to your brand, not just the one-time experience.

*Actions (think of these as your hints to advance your scenario):*

* **Build a post-game email sequence that runs on autopilot:** Create a simple 5-7 email sequence that starts the same night.  
  * Email 1 (same day): Thank them and ask for a review.  
  * Email 2 (3 days later): Share their team photo and fun stats from their game.  
  * Email 3 (1 week later): Introduce them to your other rooms.  
  * Email 4 (2 weeks later): Invite them to join your locals program or book their next visit with a limited-time offer.  
  * This takes 2-3 hours to set up once, then runs forever.  
* **Create a "VIP text list" for your most engaged locals:** Email is great for connecting, but SMS is where you drive immediate action. At checkout, invite customers to join your "VIP locals text list" for early access to new rooms, last-minute booking deals, and exclusive events. Then text them 1-2 times per month with high-value offers. This gives you a direct line to your best customers when you need to fill slots fast.  
* **Implement a simple "90-day re-engagement campaign":** Here's the reality: if someone hasn't booked with you in 90 days, they're probably not thinking about you. So create an automated trigger that flags anyone who hasn't visited in 3 months, and send them a personalized "we miss you" email with a compelling reason to come back (a new room, a special event, or a friends-and-family deal). You'll be shocked how many people were waiting for you to just ask.

***Here’s the test: would your customer come back to do an escape room and dinner instead of dinner and a movie?***

***(Side note: I have. My favorite local escape room center and my favorite restaurant are 45 minutes away from my home. We drive and make a night of it.)***

## Congrats, player, you’ve unlocked another room\!

We’ve made it into the next room, and man, does it seem huge.

Persistence is the key. You’ve got this.

Tomorrow, we’ll be dropping another email with a big hint about pricing discounts. If you don’t do this well, you might accidentally trip the launch sequence.

We’re going to talk about Mistake \#4: Using discounts to create loyalty.

Specifically:

* The reason escape room owners default to slashing prices when bookings slow down.  
* Why this mistake leads to locals only coming back when you run a sale, killing your margins.  
* And how to fix it.

# Day 4: Discounts Are False Loyalty

## **Day 4 — mistake \#4: using discounts to create loyalty**

### **Subject: Mistake \#4: discounts create cheap customers**

### **Sub-text: Customers expect what they are told to expect.**

### **Introduction**

Hey there\!

Welcome to Day 4 of The Local Loyalty Playbook.

Today we’re going to talk about Mistake \#4: Using discounts to create loyalty.

Specifically:

* The reason escape room owners default to slashing prices when bookings slow down.  
* Why this mistake leads to locals only coming back when you run a sale—which kills your margins.  
* And how to fix it.

Let’s break out of discounting, at least as a strategy to win the game.

### **Mistake \#4: Discounts instead of reasons**

Let’s think about this. Why do businesses offer discounts to try to retain customers?

They offer discounts to attract customers. They offer discounts to reward loyalty. But to retain customers? That’s a mistake. Customers return to businesses because they have reason to.

It’s easy to throw out a Groupon deal and fill a few bookings. But you’re just buying cheap customers.

When messaging relies on price instead of value, this leads to the following negative outcomes:

* **Locals delay bookings to leverage the discount.** Let’s use an example from my local context: I get an email to come in for my birthday. And that’s when I come in. Just for my birthday. My wife’s birthday is 9 days before mine. Guess who’s getting free rooms? But, guess who isn’t more brand loyal.  
* **Attracting the wrong customers.** Your Groupon players book the cheapest time slots, show up late, complain about everything, and leave a bad review. Sound about right? Your ideal customers now start to see the escape center as low value and not made for loyal players like them.  
* **Margins shrink.** Your revenue per room is now partially discounted. Leaving you with less cash per customer. There’s a race to the bottom now with competitors. The premium entertainment experience you were hoping to provide is now a tragedy of the commons.  
* **Loyalty disappears or is non-existent.** See above.

### **The reason this happens**

The reason this happens is because it’s preferable to get some revenue vs. zero revenue.

To get bookings, especially in slow seasons, it’s easier to throw out a discount and hope it ensures bookings. This neglects the longer-term relationship with your locals. You’re hoping the discount buys loyalty.

But here’s the brutal truth: cheap customers will be cheap customers.

Here are some reasons it’s easy to fall into the discount cycle instead of creating reasons to come back:

* **Confusing incentives with discounts**. You think the only way to motivate someone to book is to lower the price. However, there are dozens of incentives that drive bookings without touching your pricing (e.g. exclusive access, limited availability, special experiences, recognition, competition, social proof). Discounting is lazy marketing disguised as strategy.  
* **Not being aware of customer lifetime value.** The average local customer will come back 3 times, or more, as part of their lifecycle. If you knew that, you’d never discount again. You’d be trying to get incentives for that same customer to come back 3 times per year. Optimizing for short-term bookings overlooks lifetime value.  
* **One offer; one price point.** Most escape rooms have one price point \- the cost for a one-time booking. You can only go down from there. Most successful businesses have multiple price points, including an exclusive tier. Think about selling memberships, hosting competitions, offering team packages, collaborating with local restaurants and retail for “holiday packages,” VIP experiences, etc. The treasure is right in front of you.

### **The fix**

Well, Escape Room Dad, what do we do about it?

You use discounts to drive scarcity, exclusivity, and time-bound experiences. You want locals to say, “Can I afford to miss this?” You want locals coming in and having such a great experience that they generate the buzz you were hoping for.

*So let’s pry open that box lid (don’t worry, it’s not labeled “DO NOT OPEN”) and see what we should do instead of offering a persistent offer code.*

What are some action steps here?

* **Create "value-add" offers instead of price cuts:** Don’t lower your price. Add more value instead. Instead of "20% off Tuesday bookings," offer "Book Tuesday and get a free replay pass for your next visit" or "Tuesday bookings get exclusive access to our new room one week early." You're filling the same slots, but you're conditioning customers to expect more value, not lower prices. Bonus hint: replay passes and early access cost you almost nothing but feel incredibly valuable.  
* **Launch limited-time experiences, not limited-time discounts:** Scarcity drives action. We just don’t want it to be price-based scarcity. Create limited-time experiences like "This month only: Halloween Horror Mode in our Haunted Mansion room" or "Valentine's Special: Couples-only bookings with champagne toast included." Now people are booking because they don't want to miss out on the experience, not because it's cheaper.  
* **Build a locals membership that replaces discounts entirely:** Stop doing one-off discounts and create a $19-29/month locals membership instead. Members get priority booking, one free game per month, exclusive event access, and VIP perks—but they pay a recurring fee. Now you have predictable monthly revenue, customers who are invested in your business, and zero need to discount because members already feel like they're getting insane value. This is how you escape the discount trap permanently.

When the message is right, price becomes secondary.

## We’re almost to the end. Are you ready to break out and get some local loyalty?

We learned about discounts being like using unlimited hints. You might win, but at a cost.

Tomorrow, we’re going to talk about Mistake \#5: No local identity or loyalty.

Specifically:

* The reason escape room owners fail to differentiate themselves in the market.  
* Why this mistake makes you interchangeable with every other escape room within 50 miles.  
* And how to fix it.

# Day 5: No Local Identity

## **Day 5 — mistake \#5: no local identity**

### **Subject: Mistake \#5: no loyalty system**

### **Sub-text: Escape rooms without loyalty systems don’t have customers. They have transactions.**

### **Introduction**

Hey there\!

Welcome to Day 5 of The Local Loyalty Playbook.

Today we’re going to talk about Mistake \#5: No local identity.

Specifically:

* The reason escape room owners fail to differentiate themselves in the market.  
* Why this mistake makes you interchangeable with every other escape room within 50 miles.  
* And how to fix it.

Let’s get going. 60 minutes on the clock.

### **Mistake \#5: No local identity**

What do locals say about your escape room?

“Oh, that’s the one down by the beach.”

“Oh, that’s the one that has 8 DIFFERENT ROOMS.”

Congrats, your escape room can be in literally any town anywhere else. You don’t have a unique identity.

When you’re just like everyone else, locals have zero reasons to be specifically loyal to you. That’s why you’re interchangeable with every other escape room, and I’d argue, other entertainment options, within a 50 mile radius.

This mistake leads to the following negative outcomes:

* **You compete on price and location only:** The only factors that matter to discount-hunting customers are "How much does it cost?" and "How close is it?" You can't command premium pricing. You can't build a loyal following. You can't become the obvious choice for local events and celebrations. You're just one option among many.  
* **Your marketing falls flat because you sound like everyone else:** Look at your website, your Instagram, your Google listing. Now look at your three closest competitors. Do you see the difference? Probably not (I don’t). You're all using the same stock photos, the same "perfect for team building and birthdays\!" copy, the same promises. When your marketing is identical to everyone else's, people scroll right past you. There's nothing to grab onto, nothing memorable, nothing that screams "This is THE place."  
* **You can't build a community because there's nothing to rally around:** The escape rooms that create true local loyalty aren't just businesses. They're community hubs with personalities, values, and cultures that locals identify with. But when you have no identity, you can't build community. There's nothing for superfans to champion, nothing for regulars to feel like they're "part of," nothing that makes them say "This is MY escape room."

### **The reason this happens**

The reason this happens is that escape room owners appeal to everyone. The opposite happens. *This appeals to no one instead.*

The trap is that is thinking that by being generic and broad, you'll capture the widest possible audience. Tourist families, bachelor parties, corporate groups, locals, kids, adults, puzzle enthusiasts, casual players—you want them all. So you water down your messaging, your branding, your entire identity to be as inoffensive and accessible as possible.

**But in trying to be everything to everyone, you become nothing to anyone.**

Here are some even more specific reasons why escape room owners fail to build a distinct local identity:

* **You're copying national chains instead of owning your local advantage:** You look at the big franchise escape rooms and think "I should do what they do." So you copy their professional-but-generic branding, their corporate event focus, their sanitized social media presence. But you're not a national chain. You can't out-corporate the corporations. Your advantage is that you're LOCAL—but you're not leaning into it at all.  
* **You think "themes" are the same as "identity":** Having a pirate room, a zombie room, and a heist room is not an identity. Those are just product offerings. Your identity is your personality, your values, your vibe, your role in the community.  
  It's the difference between saying: "We have some escape rooms" and saying "We're the weird, quirky, puzzle-obsessed locals who throw the best game nights in town and happen to also run escape rooms."  
* **You're afraid to alienate anyone (so you connect with no one):** You're scared that if you take a strong stance, develop a distinct personality, or target a specific type of customer, you'll lose everyone else. But the opposite is true. When you try to be liked by everyone, nobody feels strongly about you at all. The businesses that build tribal followings are the ones willing to say "This is who we are, this is what we stand for, and if that's not your thing, that's okay."

### **The fix**

So, just bring me home and let’s get that final lock out of the way…

You need an identity rooted in the community.

Most franchise escape rooms name themselves \[Franchise Name\] \+ \[Your Town\]. You’re different. What can you do to show you’re part of the town?

You can take the following actions:

* #### **Signal identity: You want locals saying "this escape room is part of our Main Street." Some specific ideas:**

1. **Establish a sense of place:** What makes your escape center local? You grew up here? Community connection and story? This grounds the escape room center in the local geography and community and goes beyond simply listing the address.  
2. **Highlight local partnerships/features:** Mention nearby landmarks, popular local businesses, or community events. This reinforces the idea that the escape room is a contributing member of the neighborhood ecosystem, not just a generic entertainment venue.  
3. **Use regional vernacular/references:** Incorporate local slang, historical references, or inside jokes that resonate specifically with people in your area. Talk about local history, for example. My first escape room was tied to a local bank robbery. The concept of time travel back to the scenario that absolutely could’ve fit into the 1920s \- **\*chef’s kiss\***. This creates an immediate feeling of familiarity and shared identity with the recipients. Another example: Instead of "the downtown area," use "the historic market district." Talk to your locals like a local.  
* **Reinforce community:** You want locals to extend the community vibe into your escape center. The center is not just a tourist activity, but has local cache.  
* **Foster inclusivity and belonging:** Position the escape room as a gathering place for local friends, families, and organizations—a community hub for fun and problem-solving. You likely have a corner tucked away or a small waiting area. Occasionally open that up for events.  
* **Showcase local successes/groups:** Feature stories or photos of local teams (school groups, local company outings, neighborhood friend groups) who completed a room. This validates the experience as a communal activity enjoyed by "people like us."  
* **Civic engagement:** Mention local causes, charities, or events your escape room center supports or participates in. This subtly communicates that the business cares about the well-being and life of the broader city.

We made it\! We won\!

Now you know the 5 mistakes and how to fix them.

* Treating locals like tourists  
* Relying on new rooms as the only reason to return  
* Having no post-game relationship  
* Using discounts instead of reasons  
* Having no local identity

You’re ready to welcome your locals back in, build some loyalty, and at full-price.

You’re ready to get those corporate bookings locked in.

All while making sure tourists flow through the doors during peak season.

You’ve got this. Hope I can visit your local room sometime while I’m stopping in and see how well you include the locals.

Breaking through one clue at a time,

### **Day 1 Template: Recap \+ More Free Stuff**

Hey there\!

Thank you again for signing up for The Local Loyalty Playbook: Escape Room Owners in Tourist Markets: Avoid These 5 Mistakes That Kill Local Repeat Bookings, Leave You Dependent on One-Time Tourists, and Force You to Constantly Discount (And How To Fix Them Even If Your Rooms Are “Fully Booked” on Weekends).

*As a recap, here’s everything we covered (can you believe it?\!):*

* **Mistake \#1:** *Treating locals like tourists*. Why locals come once, never return, and tell friends “it’s fun… once.”  
* **Mistake \#2:** *Relying on new rooms as the only reason to return*; you burn $25K-$50K or more on constant rebuilds just to stay relevant.  
* **Mistake \#3:** *No post-game relationship* and why customers leave, forget you exist, and book your competitors next time.  
* **Mistake \#4:** *Discounts instead of reasons* or why locals only come back when you slash prices, which is killing your margins.  
* **Mistake \#5:** *No local identity*, which is why you’re interchangeable with every other escape room within 50 miles.

# FOMO Day 2

*Hey there\!*

*Quick question:*

*Have you been struggling with retaining customers? Where they had a good time initially but just fade away?*

### ***I know that all too well—and I want to share a story with you:***

*I’ve been a part of a training initiative where we tried to train people a new skill, and then ensure that they could keep coming back for workshops at their own cost, all with no budget for recognition. I wasn’t able to bribe people with swag; I had to appeal to their sense of adventure and the benefits.*

*Most people try to solve this problem in 3 ways:*

* ***\#1:** They try spray and pray, which leads to everyone feeling the same and no one checking in.*  
* ***\#2:** They try making a bunch of calls, which leads to fatigue and burnout.*  
* ***\#3:** They try going back to doing nothing, which leads to entropy and everyone forgetting about you.*

*And I don’t blame them.*

*Because I made these same 3 mistakes\!*

*Until I realized the power of targeted, timed email sequences, and all of a sudden loyalty and engagement went up.*

### ***So, if you have been feeling frustrated because you’ve been trying spray and pray; calling everyone, or just giving up, not seeing the local loyalty and repeat customer base you wanted, I can help.***

I specialize in email/SMS sequences.

And I work exclusively with escape room operators in tourist towns to help them discover local, loyal customers and build predictable revenue streams.

And I firmly believe I can help you as well.

No pressure, but would love to find some time to chat so I can save you from making all the same mistakes I covered —and help you accelerate to $400 or more LTV per customer exponentially faster.

You can book a time with me on my calendar here. Or, feel free to reply directly to this email and let me know what you’re struggling with—and I’ll share some suggestions.

Looking forward to chatting soon,

Hey \[contact first name\], just wanted to send you a quick note:

Just a heads up, my calendar is starting to fill (a lot faster than I anticipated).

No pressure, just wanted to let you know. So if you’ve been on the fence, please grab a time so we can chat. I have a feeling I’ll be completely full and unable to take on any new clients after next week.

And if you have any immediate questions, just reply directly to this email and, at a minimum, I can help point you in the right direction to help you solve local brand loyalty issues and start creating local, predictable revenue.

Talk soon,
